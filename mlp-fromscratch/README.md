# mlp-fromscratch
Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) model made from scratch in python (pytorch based)

This is a project of MLP model developed from scratch in python (pytorch based). I also added the equivalent model built in pytorch neural network framework. I made the model for 1 and 2 hidden layers. The model implements ADAM optimizer (gradient momentum, RMS prop) and the gradient is calculated manually using differential chain rule. The data is scaled first with mean and standard deviation normalization. The model architecture for 1 hidden layer is depicted in the following image.
